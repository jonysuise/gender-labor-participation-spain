# Gender Labor Force Forecast – Spain 🇪🇸

This project analyzes and forecasts the **female-to-male labor force participation ratio** in **Spain**, using data from the [World Bank Gender Statistics](https://databank.worldbank.org/).

## 📊 Motivation

Spain introduced major gender equality reforms in **2021**. This project asks:
- Did the 2021 reforms have a measurable impact?
- When will Spain reach gender parity in the labor force?
- What can we learn from past trends?

## ✅ Summary of Results

- Spain's labor force gender ratio increased from **79.4% in 2014** to **84.1% in 2023**
